<h1>Welcome to the fun remake of Minesweeper!!!</h1>
<h2>You are able to change game configuration (field size, bombs amount etc) in 'config.json' which is 
located in the root directory. To run the game: cd to the game's root directory
and use a command 'python main.py', you need to have python installed (preferably
one of the new versions) in order to do it though. For external modules, you
only need to pip install 'pygame'. Plz no bully</h2>
<h1>CONTROLS</h1>
<h2>r - restart the game; right mouse button - reveal block; left mouse button - put / remove flag</h2>
<h2>The game is going to end when you have putted flags all over every single mine</h2>
